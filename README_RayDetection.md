# Ray-Based Detection System Implementation

## Overview
We've successfully replaced the performance-heavy `Physics2D.OverlapCircleAll` detection system with a ray-based 360° detection system using the existing `MultiRayShooter` component with minimal modifications.

## Setup Required

### Add New Tags
To use this system, you need to add two new tags in Unity:
1. **"Albert"** - for Albert-type creatures
2. **"Kai"** - for Kai-type creatures

**How to add tags:**
1. In Unity, click the "Tag" dropdown in the Inspector
2. Select "Add Tag..."
3. Add "Albert" and "Kai" to the Tags list

The system will automatically assign the correct tag to each creature based on its `CreatureType` in the `Start()` method.

## What Was Changed

### MultiRayShooter.cs (Modified)
- **Added hit data storage**: New data structures to store raycast hits for other systems to access
- **Added convenience methods**: Methods to retrieve nearest hits by tag and get all hits
- **Added 360° configuration**: `ConfigureFor360Detection()` method to set up full circle detection
- **Enhanced Update logic**: Handles 360° mode where direction doesn't matter
- **Improved ray visualization**: Lines now show actual hit points instead of full ray length

### Creature.cs (Modified)
- **Integrated MultiRayShooter**: Uses the ray shooter component for detection instead of OverlapCircle
- **Automatic tag assignment**: Sets "Albert" or "Kai" tags automatically based on creature type
- **Simplified ray detection**: `DetectObjectsWithRays()` uses direct tag-based lookups (much cleaner code)
- **Toggle system**: `useRayDetection` flag allows switching between detection methods
- **Performance optimization**: Fixed range (20 units) instead of progressive detection ranges

### PerformanceTest.cs (New)
- **Real-time performance monitoring**: Shows FPS and frame time
- **Detection method toggling**: Press 'T' to switch between ray-based and OverlapCircle detection
- **Live creature count**: Displays number of active creatures
- **Visual performance feedback**: On-screen GUI with performance metrics

## Key Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **360° coverage with fixed cost**: 36 rays provide complete detection coverage
- **Single detection pass**: No more progressive range expansion
- **Reduced collision queries**: One raycast per direction vs multiple OverlapCircle calls
- **Optimized for many creatures**: Better scaling with creature count

### Detection Quality
- **Full 360° awareness**: Creatures can detect objects in any direction
- **Consistent range**: Fixed 20-unit detection range for all object types
- **Precise hit detection**: Ray-based detection is more accurate than area-based overlap

### Code Quality
- **Minimal changes to existing code**: Preserved the teammate's MultiRayShooter design
- **Backward compatibility**: Can still use OverlapCircle detection if needed
- **Clean integration**: Ray shooter data seamlessly feeds into existing AI observations

## Usage

### Testing Performance
1. Add the `PerformanceTest` script to any GameObject in the scene
2. Run the simulation and observe the FPS counter
3. Press 'T' to toggle between detection methods and compare performance
4. Monitor the profiler to see the difference in `Physics2D.OverlapCircleAll` usage

### Configuration
The ray detection system is configured in `Creature.Start()`:
- **Ray count**: 36 rays (10° intervals)
- **Detection range**: 20 units
- **Layer mask**: Trees, Alberts, Kais, Ground
- **Visual effects**: Disabled for performance

### Switching Detection Methods
You can toggle between detection systems:
- **Ray-based**: `useRayDetection = true` (default)
- **OverlapCircle**: `useRayDetection = false` (fallback)

## Results Expected
Based on the profiler showing `Physics2D.OverlapCircleAll` as the major bottleneck (72.5% of frame time), switching to ray-based detection should provide significant performance improvements, especially with many creatures in the scene.

The ray-based system provides better spatial awareness (360° vs progressive detection) while being more performance-friendly than the area-based overlap detection.
